# Beastfolk of The Forgotten Realms
This is a repository where I stumble my way through trying to mod for Baldur's Gate 3. Help me if you want to
 
 
The intention is to create the anthropomorphic animal races ('Beastfolk', a term used in Elder Scrolls) from 5e Dungeons and Dragons, and import them within Baldur's Gate 3. After they're done, I will be willing to add homebrew races and races from previous editions of the game
 
I have experience with 3D modeling, but not a whole lot on coding for BG3. So I will be stumbling a lot.
 
 
If you want to help me, feel free to. You can DM me on Discord if you want @clobbiteas
 
Yeah this is basically a furry mod. I'm a furry. What about it?
 
 
The current plan, in order (When these are done I'll work on more when I have time):
 
Tabaxi
 
Harengon
 
Leonin
