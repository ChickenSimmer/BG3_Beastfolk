# Beastfolk of The Forgotten Realms
This is a repository where I stumble my way through trying to mod for Baldur's Gate 3. Help me if you want to
 
 
The intention is to create the anthropomorphic animal races ('Beastfolk', a term used in Elder Scrolls) from 5e Dungeons and Dragons, and import them within Baldur's Gate 3. After they're done, I will be willing to add homebrew races and races from previous editions of the game
 
I have experience with 3D modeling, but not a whole lot on coding for BG3. So I will be stumbling a lot.
 
 
If you want to help me, feel free to. You can DM me on Discord if you want @clobbiteas
 
Yeah this is basically a furry mod. I'm a furry. What about it?
 
Also the order of things is biased because my friend and I have Tabaxi and Harengon characters, respectively. We want to play as our characters in BG3 at some point.
 
 
The current plan, in order:
Tabaxi

Harengon

Leonin


Possible other races, in no specific order (Feel free to suggest any canon anthro races in DnD, even if they're just statblock monsters):

Kobold (rework the current models in the game)

Lizardfolk (Probably add croc/gator, geckos, maybe some third thing)

Aarakocra (probably have subraces for different kinds of birds with the main being eagles)

Kenku

Minotaur (rework the current models in the game)

Tortle

Giff

Hadozee

Owlin
Loxodon
Kuo-Toa (rework the current models in the game)
Locathah (might be a reskinned Kuo-toa)
Grung
Bullywug (might be a reskinned grung)
Gnoll (rework the current models in the game)
yikaria (might be a reskinned Minotaur)

Races that I'm not sure how to make it work, but I could try:
Yuan-Ti (How would I do the tail?)
Thri-Kreen (Their secondary arms would have to be decorative)
Centaur (Idk how the horse half would work)

Possible homebrew/previous edition/alt campaign setting races (feel free to suggest some - I will not be making up any myself):
Ratatosk (3e)
Rodentfolk (homebrew - Probably include mice and jerboa)
