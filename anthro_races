Possible other races, in no specific order (Feel free to suggest any canon anthro races in DnD, even if they're just statblock monsters):
Kobold (rework the current models in the game)
Lizardfolk (Probably add croc/gator, geckos, maybe some third thing)
Aarakocra (probably have subraces for different kinds of birds with the main being eagles)
Kenku
Minotaur (rework the current models in the game)
Tortle
Giff
Hadozee
Owlin
Loxodon
Kuo-Toa (rework the current models in the game)
Locathah (might be a reskinned Kuo-toa)
Grung
Bullywug (might be a reskinned grung)
Gnoll (rework the current models in the game)
yikaria (might be a reskinned Minotaur)

Races that I'm not sure how to make it work, but I could try:
Yuan-Ti (How would I do the tail?)
Thri-Kreen (Their secondary arms would have to be decorative)
Centaur (Idk how the horse half would work)

Possible homebrew/previous edition/alt campaign setting races (feel free to suggest some - I will not be making up any myself):
Ratatosk (3e)
Rodentfolk (homebrew - Probably include mice, rats, and jerboa)
